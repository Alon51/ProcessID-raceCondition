int allocate_map() - Function to create the process.
int allocate_pid() - Function that assign the ID to the process
void release_pid(int pid) - To release  the ID of a specific process. One argument, the pid to release.
void display() - Display output at any given time of IDs that in use.
void sleepSimulation() - The sleep simulation will set the program to wort automatically when the user press 4 in the keyboard.
						That function will call the allocate_pid number of times.
void sleepTime(int) - The sleep time demonstrating the illusion that a process is currently running and modifying data. 
					  The parameter the function gets represent the time that the thread sleeping.
